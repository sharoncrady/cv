<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="blue-text">A little about me:  My name is Sharon.  I am a widow of 5 years now and mother of one child.  We travel around too, but for now, we are stationary and we are having a nice long visit with family.  I am an independent contractor that works remotely on the phone from my computer and I love it.  However, I am looking to get off the phone as soon as possible and do non phone type work instead.  My work experience is in phone customer service and telephone interviewing for polling companies, asking voters questions on political surveys and recording their responses electronically.  So, I am studying Web Developing and I am enjoying it very much.</p>
