  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <div class="div-dimensions">
    <p>
      A little about me: My name is Sharon. I am a widow of 6 years now and mother of one child.
      We travel around too, but for now, we are stationary and we are having a nice long visit with
      family, which has basically turned into us living here. Haha! I am an independent contractor
      that works remotely on the phone from my computer and I love it. However, I am looking to get
      off the phone as soon as possible and do non-phone type work instead. My work experience is in
      phone customer service and telephone interviewing for polling companies, asking voters questions
      on political surveys and recording their responses electronically. So, I am studying Web Developing
      and I am enjoying it very much.
