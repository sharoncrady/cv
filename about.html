  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <div class="div-dimensions">
    <p>
A little about me: My name is Sharon.  I am a widow of 6 years now and the mother of one child.  We travel around, but we were stationary with our immediate family in Dallas, Texas for a year and 11 months.  We finally left there and returned to my residential home state of Michigan.  We are now staying with a friend/brother of mine(not related, but sometimes the best family is not by blood).  Anyway, we are now staying in Michigan for as long as we need until I am ready to hit the road again.  We are having a great time here.  It's good to be back in Michigan.

As for work, I am an independent contractor that works remotely on the phone from my computer and I love it.  However, I am looking to get off the phone as soon as possible and do non-phone type work instead.  My work experience is n phone customer service and telephone interviewing for polling companies, asking voters questions on political surveys and recording their responses electronically.  So, I am studying Web Development, and I am enjoying it very much.
